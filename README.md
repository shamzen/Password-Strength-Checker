## 📌 Description

🔑 **Task:**  
Build a tool to assess the strength of a password based on:
- Length (8+ characters)
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

🔍 **Why?**  
Weak passwords are still the top reason people get hacked. A good security researcher knows how to test, break, and teach better password hygiene.
